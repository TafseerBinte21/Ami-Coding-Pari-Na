1. Install sprintool (any IDE will work but I prefer this one)
2. Download the zip file from git link and extract. Then import the project in the springtool
3. After importing you will have access to the code files. Then click at a play button above and run as "spring app"
4. After successfull running in the IDE , go to any browser and type "local host:8080" if it does not work type "local host:8080/registration"
5. About database - in a file call application properties just add the schema name and create a same schema in workbench software
